====== 5. Favorites Sidebar ======

One Commander allows you to identify as many favorite folders as you like. They are arranged into groups in the [[2. Full Reference Guide:Favorites Sidebar|Favorites Sidebar]]. One Commander creates an initial group from a list of standard folders in your C:\Users\<username> folder.
