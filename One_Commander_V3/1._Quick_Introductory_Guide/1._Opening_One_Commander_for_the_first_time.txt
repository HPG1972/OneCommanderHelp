====== 1. Opening One Commander for the first time ======

One Commander is a dual-pane file manager, meaning that it can simultaneously display either one or two independent [[3. The Browsers|file browsers]] within the same window. The browsers can be viewed either vertically, with a navigation pane at the top and a detailed view of the current folder at the bottom, or in a more compact horizontal layout. You can switch between the two views using the "Layout" button or make one browser collapse to give a single-browser view.
