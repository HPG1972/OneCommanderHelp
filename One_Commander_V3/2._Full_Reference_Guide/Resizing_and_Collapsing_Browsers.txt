====== Resizing and Collapsing Browsers ======
Created Saturday 25 July 2020


===== Resizing individual panes =====
Each individual pane is surrounded by a grey border that can be dragged to resize the pane in question. Some borders appear when the cursor moves over them, but are hidden otherwise.
Each **column** has a minimum width. In the **vertical layout**, if you try to reduce the width of one of the two file panels below the minimum width, the panel collapses, yielding a single-panel view. You can restore the two-panel view by dragging the right-hand side of the left single-panel border to the right.

===== Collapsing a browser to create a single-browser layout =====
