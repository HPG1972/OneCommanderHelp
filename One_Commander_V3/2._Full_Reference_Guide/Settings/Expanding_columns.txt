====== Expanding columns ======
The [[Folder columns|columns]] in the Folder view pane expand when the cursor moves over them, a modification of the widely-used technique called Miller Columns or cascading lists. You can adjust two features:
* The delay between when the cursor moves into a column and the column expanding (i.e. how responsive the column-expanding is to the cursor passing over the column).
* The length of time it takes for the column to expand (i.e. how fast it expands).

Each parameter is set in milliseconds (ms).
